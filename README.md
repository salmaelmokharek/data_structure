These are data structures and sorting algorithms I’m working on mastering. 
They’re tricky, and here’s why:

# Data Structures
Binary Heap
Why Tough: Array-based tree is confusing. Heapify (shifting up/down) feels random.
Problem: Don’t get how it stays fast for adding/removing.

Binary Search Tree (BST)
Why Tough: Adding and deleting nodes messes me up.
Problem: Can’t keep it balanced in my head.

# Sorting Algorithms
Heap Sort
Why Tough: Heap to sorted list is a blur.
Problem: Don’t see how it’s sorted in-place.

Quick Sort
Why Tough: Pivot picking and recursion trip me up.
Problem: Slows down with bad pivots, and I don’t know why yet.

Why I’m Stuck
Hard to picture without more practice.
Haven’t coded them enough myself.

Plan
Use VisuAlgo more.
Code them step-by-step.
